    <h2 style="font-size: 28px;">Graphic Design Work</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">This section of the digital portfolio will shows some of the Graphic Design work I have done, based of a brief Given to me</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Some of the work you will see here will be either from my work I did at College or my Graphic Design course work</p>
</center>

 <center> <img src="Brainstorm- Festivel.png" alt="Brainstorm of Native American Festival" style="width:600px;height:400px;" class="responsive"> </center>
    <center> <p style="font-size: 16px;">This is a Brainstorm of an Native American Festival, the brainstorm includes thoughts I think of when thinking about Native Americans and what their Festival will have and look like.</p>
     <p style="font-size: 16px;">This Brainstorm is the starts of plans of the graphic work, once and Brainstorm is complete I then did some research and searched up some images that will be suitable and that I would migtht need to use later. With the research, I can then create a mooboard filled wth the images I have found.
       
	     <center> <img src="MoodBoard.PNG" alt="MoodBoard of Native American Festival" style="width:600px;height:400px;" class="responsive"> </center> 
	     <p style="font-size: 16px;">This is the Moodboard I created based of the images from my search, as you can see the images are all things I think represent Native American Culture and that it would be the perfect start for potential Design Ideas.</p>
	      <p style="font-size: 16px;"> After the MoodBoard I started to think of Potential Logos for the Main Fesstival and that Logo will be used on Posters, Banners, Brochures and other promotial content. I looked at my moodboard to see if any of the images I had found could be used when representing the logo. Out of all the Images I have two potential Images I could use for the Logo, I created them and this is how it turned out.</p>
	
	    <center> <img src="Logo's.PNG" alt="Logos for the Native American Festival" style="width:900px;height:400px;" class="responsive"> </center> 
	   <p style="font-size: 16px;">The end result I decided to go with the Feathered themed Logo, as it seemed to fit well with the text better than the raven did. Now that I chose A logo I can show examples of real life examples of the logo being used on t-shirts or other merchandise.</p>
             <p style="font-size: 16px;">Here are the examples I created for the logo to be shown on.</p>
	          <center> <img src="Real Life Examples.PNG" alt="Real life examples of the logo being used" style="width:600px;height:400px;" class="responsive"> </center>
	    <p style="font-size: 16px;">As you can see the logo fits well with real life examples and will be easy to identify for the festival.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p style="font-size: 16px;">The next step was to sketch out some design, that would be logo's for some of the facilities at the festival, such as; Food stalls, Toilets, Pottery and others</p>
	    <p style="font-size: 16px;">These are my simple Computer based sketches I created that can then be turned into logo's for facilities around the festival.</p>
	         <center> <img src="Sketches _ Plans.jpg" alt="Real life examples of the logo being used" style="width:600px;height:400px;" class="responsive"> </center>
	    <p style="font-size: 16px;">With the Sketches done I can take all the work I have already done and put it all together in Illustrator, We need to put all the work I did on one page so that I can see all of the designs and image's I saved for Ideas</p>
	      <p style="font-size: 16px;">With my workspace set out I started to think on what I wanted to use for the logo's I was going to create, I based it of the sketches I created and used the Images that correlate the sketches.</p>
	           <center> <img src="Festival logo's.PNG" alt="Logo's for festival" style="width:600px;height:400px;" class="responsive"> </center>
	    <p style="font-size: 16px;">These are my final designs for the logo's that will b around the festival, so it will be easy to Identify what each area of the festival is. Here I have created one based on music, pottery, the bathrooms and food.</p>
	   <br>
	        <p style="font-size: 16px;">I decided to create a poster for the festival and see how well my logo and designing will be.</p>
	            <p style="font-size: 16px;">I stuck with te theme of Native American Festival and found some images that would best represent it and added this to the poster, instead of plain white paper, I decided to use something that also fitswell with the Native American theme and found a sample of old fashoined paper, I lowered the opacity to make it a lighter shade so that the texts can still be seen.</p>
	                  <center> <img src="Escape Poster.PNG" alt="Native American Escape Festival Poster" style="width:700px;height:800px;" class="responsive"> </center>
	        <p style="font-size: 16px;">I hope you have enjoyed seeing my work for this specific brief, I hope you have liked my designs and style of work.</p>
	          <p style="font-size: 16px;">To do this work everyday would be a dream come true, to be able to design and make people fall in love with product or company or a theme, It would mean so much to me. Thanks for taking the time to see my Graphic's work.</p>
