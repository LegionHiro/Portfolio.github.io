    <h2 style="font-size: 28px;">Graphic Design Work</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">This section of the digital portfolio will shows some of the Graphic Design work I have done, based of a brief Given to me</p>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Some of the work you will see here will be either from my work I did at College or my Graphic Design course work</p>
</center>

 <center> <img src="Brainstorm- Festivel.png" alt="Brainstorm of Native American Festival" style="width:600px;height:400px;" class="responsive"> </center>
    <center> <p style="font-size: 16px;">This is a Brainstorm of an Native American Festival, the brainstorm includes thoughts I think of when thinking about Native Americans and what their Festival will have and look like.</p>
     <p style="font-size: 16px;">This Brainstorm is the starts of plans of the graphic work, once and Brainstorm is complete I then did some research and searched up some images that will be suitable and that I would migtht need to use later. With the research, I can then create a mooboard filled wth the images I have found.
       
	     <center> <img src="MoodBoard.PNG" alt="MoodBoard of Native American Festival" style="width:600px;height:400px;" class="responsive"> </center> 
	     <p style="font-size: 16px;">This is the Moodboard I created based of the images from my search, as you can see the images are all things I think represent Native American Culture and that it would be the perfect start for potential Design Ideas.</p>
	      <p style="font-size: 16px;"> After the MoodBoard I started to think of Potential Logos for the Main Fesstival and that Logo will be used on Posters, Banners, Brochures and other promotial content. I looked at my moodboard to see if any of the images I had found could be used when representing the logo. Out of all the Images I have two potential Images I could use for the Logo, I created them and this is how it turned out.</p>
	
	    <center> <img src="Logo's.PNG" alt="Logos for the Native American Festival" style="width:900px;height:400px;" class="responsive"> </center> 
	   <p>The end result I decided to go with the Feathered themed Logo, as it seemed to fit well with the text better than the raven did. Now that I chose A logo I can show examples of real life examples of the logo being used on t-shirts or other merchandise.</p>
             <p>Here are the examples I created for the logo to be shown on.</p>
	          <center> <img src="Real Life Examples.PNG" alt="Real life examples of the logo being used" style="width:600px;height:400px;" class="responsive"> </center>
	    <p>As you can see the logo fits well with real life examples and will be easy to identify for the festival.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>The next step was to sketch out some design, that would be logo's for some of the facilities at the festival, such as; Food stalls, Toilets, Pottery and others</p>
	    <p>These are my simple Computer based sketches I created that can then be turned into logo's for facilities around the festival.</p>
